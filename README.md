# Caduceus

## 1. Core Simulation Engine

- [ ] Server-authoritative patient simulation
- [ ] Finite-State Machine (FSM)–based patient conditions
- [ ] Vitals that change over time
- [ ] State transitions influenced by condition severity, time, and interventions
- [ ] Unexpected events that can occur during case progression
- [ ] Treatments that influence patient trajectory
- [ ] Tests that reveal information progressively
- [ ] Full separation between simulation logic and client UI

## 2. Patient Case Lifecycle

- [ ] Patient creation using predefined templates
- [ ] Assignment to a bed or slot in the hospital
- [ ] Initial limited information presented to player
- [ ] Condition evolves over time
- [ ] Player actions influence stability, recovery, or deterioration
- [ ] Case ends when the patient recovers, worsens, or times out
- [ ] Summary and feedback at the end of each case

## 3. Player Tools & Actions

- [ ] Order diagnostic tests
- [ ] Administer treatments
- [ ] Review vitals and chart data
- [ ] Respond to clinical changes and emergencies
- [ ] Make decisions about patient management
- [ ] Track progress within a case log

## 4. Scoring & Feedback System

- [ ] Points earned for appropriate actions and timely decisions
- [ ] Deductions for unnecessary or harmful choices
- [ ] End-of-case summary with performance breakdown
- [ ] Teaching objectives and competency categories
- [ ] ⏳ FUTURE FEATURES — Not in current scope

## 5. AI-Generated Case Seeding (FUTURE)

- [ ] AI-generated scenario blueprints
- [ ] Dynamic patient backgrounds and complexity
- [ ] Configurable learning objectives
- [ ] Procedurally varied case presentations

## 6. Multi-Client Hospital Environment (FUTURE)

- [ ] Multiple trainees logged into the same hospital
- [ ] Shared list of active patients
- [ ] Case claiming system
- [ ] Auto-release for idle players

## 7. Player-to-Player Case Transfers (FUTURE)

- [ ] Request and approve patient transfers
- [ ] Shared or partial scoring for transferred cases
- [ ] Transfer history log
- [ ] Optional co-management mode

## 8. Leaderboards & Social Systems (FUTURE)

- [ ] Global and specialty leaderboards
- [ ] Achievement badges
- [ ] Player profile statistics
- [ ] Hospital performance metrics

## 9. Cross-Player Case Sharing (FUTURE)

- [ ] Send a patient to another trainee
- [ ] Shared scoring for collaborative cases
- [ ] Optional cooperative teaching scenarios
